Ans: it is s a set of technologies that assemble objects from smaller pieces of material.


Q6. What are 3D printers being used for? 
Ans: Rapid prototype


Q7. What is a very common type of 3D printing? 
Ans: Filament printing 


Q8. What does FDM stand for?
Ans. Fused Deposition Modeling


Q9. Explain filament printing?
Ans. It melt filament to print 3D objects 


Q10. What are the advantages of using this type of 3D printer? **
Ans: larger print bed than resin printers, minimum of mess


Q11. How does the filament printer create 3D objects? **
Ans. layer by layer


Q12. How does an SLA printer differ from a filament printer? 
Ans. Stereolithography printer make smooth and finely detailed 3D pritns


Q13. What does an SLA printer stand for?
Ans. Stereolithography printer 


Q14. SLA Printer is often referred to as_____________. **
Ans. Resim printer 


Q15. How does SLA printers work? **
Ans. object down into ultraviolet light or a laser or liquid to make it solid, layers are added to bottom


Q16. There’s __________that sits on the bottom of this SLA printer, and the object that you’re printing is attached to a ___________that moves up and down. **
Ans. liquid, build platform 


Q17. What is the biggest challenge with resin printing? **
Ans: manage liqud


Q18. You have to use_______________, so that you don’t injure yourself when working with the resin.
Ans. wear protective gear 


Q19. What should you do with leftover resin? 
Ans: hazardous material to facility in your area


Q20. What do we refer to as the large surface used for 3D printing? 
Ans: The Printing bed


Q21. _________________ is a flat surface, and it usually is either adhesive on the bottom with your filament printing or adhesive on the top, so that you’re able to connect it to the build platform with resin printing.
Ans. The printing bed


Q22. What needs to be done to the print bed to ensure a successful print? 
Ans: completely level and completely clean


Q23. What is the print bed for filament printing? 
Ans: it is a printing surface 


Q24. What is the print bed typically made of? 
Ans: sticky material 






Q25. Are there different options for print beds? 
Ans: Yes, like large, compact 




Q26. What is the print bed in resin printing?  **
Ans: very small area of layer where is the light is able to harden the resin.
