Ans.hypervisor


Q14. ___________________ really does describe exactly what the software is doing.

Ans: Pre-configure vms installing from internet


Q34. What should you be aware of when using someone else's virtual machine? 
Ans:  pre-configure or pre-installed malware might have with vm.


Q35. What are some different ways to configure the networking between VMs? 
Ans: client side virtual machine manager have their own virtual(internal) network, shared network address (virtual machine might have exact same ip that host system have), NAT (private ip), bridge ip (every Vm has own ip address).


Q36. What type of IP address does a virtual machine use? **
Ans: Host Ip, NAT, Bridge Ip (virtual machine own IP)


Q37. How does a virtual machine obtain an IP address? **
