Q7. What are the common voltages provided by power supplies? 
Ans: 120V AC, 240V AC to DC (3.3V, 5V, 12V)


Q8. One measurement that we use with power is an ______________.
Ans. Ampere or A


Q9. What does an ampere measure? 
Ans: Rate of electrons which pass by per second.


Q10. What is voltage? 
Ans: To how much pressure electricity applies in wire or in flow.


Q11. What is a watt? 
Ans: it is a measurement of real power use. W = V x A [120V x 0.5A = 60W]


Q12. How would you calculate the number of watt used?
Ans. W = V x A [120V x 0.5A = 60W]




Q13. _______________ is the type of power that we are receiving from the outlet that’s in the wall. 
Ans. AC (Alternative Current)


Q14. Why do we commonly distribute power using alternating current? **
Ans. bcz it can send to very long distances


Q15. What is the power of alternating current in the US and Canada? 
Ans: 110 to 120 V of 60 Hz




Q16. What is the frequency of alternating current in Europe?
Ans: 220 to 240V of 50Hz


Q17.We often refer to the number of times this current alternates as a total number of _________________.
Ans. Cycles or hertz


Q18. If alternating current is going into our power supply, then______________, is what is coming out of our power supply and onto the _________________.
Ans. DC, Motherboard


Q19. What is the voltage and frequency for a power supply in the US? 
Ans: 120V AV, 60Hz


Q20. What is the voltage and frequency for a power supply in Europe? 
Ans: 230V AC, 50Hz


Q21. What should be done if a computer is moved from one country to another? **
Ans: Power supply changed or we need new power supply converter 


Q22. How can you determine the voltage of a wall outlet? **
Ans: multimeter 


Q23. What should you be careful of when using a manually switched power supply? 
Ans: check what power supply is coming and what devices is connecting to it.


Q24. What is the purpose of the switch on the back of the power supply? 
Ans:  maintain power supply source


Q25. What is the power supply used for? 
Ans: converting AV to DC


Q26. What is direct voltage? 
Ans: Direct voltage is contact voltage drives a current in one direction.


Q27. What is a characteristic of direct voltage? **
Ans: Specified a voltage positive value or negative value


Q28. What components typically require higher voltages? **
Ans: PCIe adapters, graphics card, hard drive motor, fans (12V)


Q29. What voltage is usually used for modern motherboards? 
Ans: 3.3V


Q30. What components take advantage of the 3.3 volts on modern motherboards? **
Ans: NIC, M.2 slots, RAM slots 


Q31. What is the Standby voltage used for? **
Ans: It is used for when system is in hibernation mode when it need to awake mode it turn of power supply (+5 VSB)


Q32. What type of components use negative 12 volts? **
Ans. Old serial ports, some PCI cards  


Q33. Are modern motherboards designed to use minus 5 volts? 
Ans. no


Q34. Does the power supply support the 120 volts used in the US? 
Ans. yes


Q35. If you add up all of the DC voltage that’s supported by this power supply, it can support a total of __________.
Ans. 850W


Q36. We get power from the power supply to the motherboard through this very large ______________.
Ans. 24 pin connector


Q37. What type of connector is used in modern systems? 
Ans: 24 pins


Q38. How do you connect the power connector to the motherboard? 
Ans: by looking connector pin and there is a only one way to connect it.


Q39. What type of computers likely have a single power supply? 
Ans: home computer


Q40. What type of devices may have multiple power supplies? 
Ans: data center and server room have multiple power supply




Q41. How is the load shared between multiple power supplies? 
Ans: it will equally distribute power load 


Q42. How do you remove a power supply from a server? **
Ans: hot-swappable (there is a switch that we can slightly push out entire power supply)


Q43. What type of connectors are typically found on the side of a power supply that goes to the motherboard? 
Ans: multiple connector 


Q44. What is a modular power supply? 
Ans: it means we can decide what type of wire connector we need for mother board or we can add new cable as we needed


Q45. How do you balance the maximum capacity of a power supply? 
Ans: by checking documentation that how much max power system needed, and then purchase power supply according to it.


Q46. Does having additional capacity in your power supply change the overall speed or efficiency of your computer? 
Ans: no


Q47. Can you purchase a power supply from any manufacturer? 
Ans: Yes


Q48. What is the physical size of power supplies?
