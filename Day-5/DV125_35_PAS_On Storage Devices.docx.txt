DV125_35_PAS On Storage Devices
Self-Assessment Sheet
Q1. What is a hard drive? 
Ans: Storage device
Q2. A hard drive consists of spinning _____________.
Ans: platter


Q3. Why are hard drives referred to as “non-volatile”? 
Ans: bcz it stored data and even if power went out it still keep data


Q4. Why do we refer to access on a hard drive as “random access.”?
Ans. Retrieve data from any part of the drive at any time


Q5. What are the components inside a hard drive? 
Ans: Spinning platters, moving actuator arm, mechanical components limit the access speed.


Q6. What is a limitation of hard drives? 
Ans: bigger size, slow read write speed


Q7. What is the eventual outcome of a hard drive? 
Ans: The eventual outcome of harddrive can vary on various factor such as usage, lifespan and external factors,over time hard drive may experience wear and tear, mechanical or electrical failures which can lead the data loss and ultimately hard drive unused.


Q8. How does the data get stored and retrieved? 
Ans: Data stored in platters and moving actuator arm will help to insert data and retrieve data from platter


Q9. What affects the speed of data retrieval? 
Ans: Spinning speed


Q10. If the drive is spinning faster, for example, at 15,000 rotations per minute, then the rotational latency lowers to about ________________. **


Ans: 2ms


Q11. What does it mean if a common rotational speed for a low-end hard drive is 5,400 rotations per minute. And that gives you a rotational latency of about 5 and 1/2 milliseconds? **
Ans. 


Q12. What happens if the drive is spinning faster?  **
Ans: faster we can read or write data


Q13. What is the size of the hard drive in a larger desktop computer?   
Ans: 3.5 inch




Q14. What is a solid-state drive? 
Ans. It is a drive with no moving parts in it.


Q15. Why do we use non- volatile memory in SSD?
Ans. better speed


Q16. What is one significant advantage of an SSD? 
Ans: faster than hard drive, small size, no need to worry about moving computer


Q17. What type of interface is often used for hard drives? 
Ans: SATA


Q18. What is the advantage of having a laptop or mobile device? 
Ans: it is very portable


Q19. How does SATA limit the size of mobile devices? 
Ans: by decreasing the size of drive


Q20. What is mSATA? 
Ans: Mini SATA




Q21. What replaced the mSATA interface? 
Ans: mSATA slot 




Q22. What is an example of a device that contains an mSATA drive? 
Ans: mobile devices, some desktop system
Q23. How does the mSATA drive help reduce the overall size of devices? 
Ans: by removing spinning drive inside case they past memory on PCB board.


Q24. AHCI stands for the__________________.
Ans. Advances Host Controller Interface


Q25. Why do we use AHCI?
Ans. It is a interface which move data from drive to RAM




Q26. _____________uses a protocol known as AHCI.
Ans. SATA


Q27. What is NVMe? 
Ans: Non Volatile Memory Express


Q28. What is the throughput of SATA revision 3? 
Ans: 600 mbps


Q29. What does lower latency and higher throughput mean? 
Ans: NVMe


Q30. What are the advantages of using M.2 instead of SATA? 
Ans: higher speed bcz there is no SATA interface




Q31. What kind of interface is M.2? 
Ans: M.2 Interface


Q32. What type of throughput is typically seen when using an NVMe with an SSD through a by 4 PCIe interface? 
Ans: 4 Gbps 


Q33. What are the different keys in an M.2 interface? **
Ans: B key, M key


Q34. What should you do to ensure the best possible throughput for an M.2-based SSD? 
Ans: NVMe


Q35. How do I install an M.2 drive on my motherboard? 
Ans: find M.2 interface and slightly insert the sloat.


Q36. What does EEPROM stand for?
Ans: Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory.


Q37. EEPROM is a type of _________ memory.
Ans. Non Volatile 


Q38. What are the advantages of flash memory? 
Ans: No power Required


Q39. What is one concern with flash memory?
