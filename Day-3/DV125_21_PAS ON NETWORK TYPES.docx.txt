DV125_21_PAS ON NETWORK TYPES


* What is a LAN?
   * Local Area Network where all devices locally connected with each other (ex all devices in office or multiple floor systems)


* What are the typical network connections for a LAN?
   * Switch


*  \What is a WAN?
   * same as LAN but compared to LAN it covered large area.
* Why are the speeds slower on a WAN compared to LAN?
   * It is because WAN is covered long distance and whenever distance is longer so it take much time than near distance so it take time to send-receive data from one location to another location.


* What are some examples of technologies used in a WAN?
   * internet, ISP provider, ATM system, Cellular network, Satellite network, etc


* How are WANs connected?
   * internet 


* What is a PAN?
   * personal area network, ex mobile hotspot


* What are some examples of technologies used in a PAN?
   * hotspot, bluetooth, NFC


* What is one of the most common ways to connect a personal area network?
   * hotspot, headphone, smart watch 


* What type of telemetry can be acquired using a personal area network?
   * health


* What is a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)?
   * It is smaller than WAN and larger than LAN such as college network.




* How does the distance of a MAN compare to that of a LAN and WAN?
   * smaller than WAN and bigger than LAN(LAN < MAN < WAN), same city 


* What is the most common topology for connecting sites in a MAN today?
   * metro ethernet


* What type of organizations tend to use Metropolitan Area Networks?
   * Government ownership


* What is a Storage Area Network (SAN)?
   * looks like local storage device,  centralized storage with block level access




* How is data accessed on a SAN?
   * solated high speed network 


* What is the typical bandwidth requirement for a SAN?
   * required a lot of bandwidth, may use separate


* Are SANs isolated on their own networks?
   * yes


* What is a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)?
   * wireless 802.11


* What is the range of a WLAN?
   * mobility, limited geographical area


* How can the size of a WLAN be extended?
   * adding extender 




* How do WLANs differ from other wireless networks?
   * WLAN can provide limited area network while wireless network can provide large distance area ex cellular network, satellite network.
