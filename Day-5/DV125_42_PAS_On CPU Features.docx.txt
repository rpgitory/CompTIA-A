Ans: 32 ibt can access 2^32 values persecond where 64 bit can access 2^64 values per seconds


Q2. A 32-bit processor can access__________ gigabytes of information, whereas a 64-bit processor can access_____________billion gigabytes of information. **
Ans. 4,17


Q3. How can you find the system type of your Windows system? 
Ans:  By system property 


Q4. What type of hardware drivers do you need if you are using a 32-bit operating system? 
Ans: 32 bit (x86)


Q5. What is x86 software? **
Ans: Reference back to intel 8086 line 


Q6. How can you tell if applications have been written for a 64-bit operating system or a 32-bit operating system? 
Ans: by looking where application has been installed (installed in \program files (x86) is referred to 32 bit, \program files is referred to 64 bit)


Q7. If you're running a 64-bit operating system, you can only run 64-bit applications, but you cannot run 32-bit applications. (True/False?
Ans.  False


Q8. What is the Advanced Risk Machine? 
Ans: It is commonly used in embedded system, mobile devices, low power devices. It reduces the instruction set of computing (RIC) architecture based efficient and power conscious computing.

Q15. If you start monitoring the amount of processing occurring on your CPU,you might see such as the _______________. 
Ans. task manager 

Q16. What does HTT stand for?
Ans. hyper-threating technology 


Q17. What is Hyper-Threading Technology? 
Ans: it is a threading which looks like there are multiple cpu running on same time but actually it is only physical cpu core running however it just made two different thread for processing.


Q18. What is the impact of hyper-threading? 
Ans: cpu can multitask and complete process early (15% to 30% improvement performance)


Q19. Does a modern operating system support hyper-threading? 
Ans: yes


Q20. What kind of hardware is needed to virtualize additional operating systems? 
Ans: hypervisor (virtualbox, vmware or software that support virtualization)
