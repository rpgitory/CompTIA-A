Ans: means we can access any part of memory storage data simply for asking for it.


Q12. What is the clock on our system used for?  **
Ans: Regulates the flow of data and out of these memory modules, and every clock cycle some data that is transfer either in or out system


Q13. Why are there notches on the bottom of the DIMMs and SO-DIMMs? **
Ans: To identify the type of memory


Q14. What if you try to install a DDR2 module into a system with a DDR3 slot?
Ans.  It not allowed to memory to install bcz of notch


Q15. What is the difference between SDR memory and DDR memory? **
Ans: Single Data Ratecan transfer one data frame per cycle while DDR (Double Data Rate) can transfer double data frame per cycle


Q16. What does DDR stand for?
Ans. Double Data Rate


Q17. Why do we use DDR?
Ans. bcz it can transmit twice of data than SDR


Q18. ___________allowed you to increase the data rates to be twice as fast as those older DDR2 systems.
Ans. DDR3


Q19. What is the maximum RAM of DDR3 memory modules? 
Ans: 16GB


Q20. What does the notch at the bottom of a DDR3 memory module do?
